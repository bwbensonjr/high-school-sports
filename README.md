# High School Sports

Scores and Elo for MA high school sports

## Overview

This project is able to create and then do daily updates of
Massachusetts high school sports teams, creating logs of matchups with
scores, and then using the scores to do Elo ratings of the teams by
sport.

## Data Source

The data comes from calls to API URLs like the following:

* https://www.bostonglobe.com/partners/data-high-school-sports-services/prd/202526/v2/scoreboard/2025-09-20.json

There is a sample data file in `data/2025-09-20.json`. The JSON data
has the following structure:

```
{
  "date": "2025-09-20",
  "dates": [
    {
      "date": "2025-09-10",
      "sports": [
        {
          "id": 54,
          "name": "field hockey",
          "gender": 2,
          "season": "fall",
          "games": [
            {
              "id": 48604,
              "date": "2025-09-10",
              "homeConference": "Bay State",
              "visitorConference": "Bay State",
              "tourneyName": null,
              "tourneyLevel": null,
              "time": "4:00 P.M.",

              "teams": {
                "visitor": {
                  "id": 4279,
                  "teamPageUrl": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/high-schools/schedule?sport=field-hockey&school=newton-north",
                  "name": "Newton North",
                  "score": "0",
                  "tracked": "1",
                  "outcome": "0"
                },
                "home": {
                  "id": 4059,
                  "teamPageUrl": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/high-schools/schedule?sport=field-hockey&school=brookline",
                  "name": "Brookline",
                  "score": "3",
                  "tracked": "1",
                  "outcome": "1"
                }
              },
              "overtime": null,
              "isShootoutWin": 0,
              "gameUrl": null,
              "story": {
                "preview": null,
                "url": null,
                "author": null
              },
              "lastUpdated": 1757556807
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        ...
      ],
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
  
Per-sport CSV files are automatically generated in the `data` directory like
`data/field-hockey-2025.csv` that contain game results and upcoming matchups between the teams.

## Data Processing

The `process_games.py` script handles fetching and processing game data from the Boston Globe API:

### Usage

```bash
# Process games for a single date
python process_games.py --date 2025-09-20

# Process games for a date range
python process_games.py --start 2025-09-20 --end 2025-09-25

# Run tests to verify update functionality
python process_games.py --test

# Show help
python process_games.py --help
```

### Features

- **Automatic data fetching**: Downloads game data directly from the Boston Globe API
- **Smart updates**: Running the same date multiple times updates existing CSV files without creating duplicates
- **Score updates**: Games initially marked as "UPCOMING" are updated with final scores when re-processed
- **Date range processing**: Process multiple days of games in a single command
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and invalid dates
- **Built-in testing**: Comprehensive tests verify that game updates work correctly

### Output

The script creates separate CSV files for each sport (e.g., `boys-soccer-2025.csv`, `field-hockey-2025.csv`) with columns including:
- Game date and ID
- Home and visitor teams (names and IDs)
- Scores and outcomes
- Game status (FINAL, UPCOMING, etc.)
- Conference information
- Game time and metadata

## Computing Elo

The code in `elo.py` is used to compute per-team Elo ratings based on
the scores in the CSV files generated by `process_games.py`.
