In two games, McCormack has accumulated 426 yards and eight rushing touchdowns, eclipsing 3,000 career rushing yards in the victory. \"Brady is a once in a generation talent,\" Medfield coach Erik Ormberg said. \"It's been a good start, one of the best starts we've had in a few years.\" McCormack only trails Mike Lane for the school rushing yard record, who amassed 4,005 career yards at Medfield. Right behind McCormack was Matteo Benson, who ran for 122 yards and a touchdown. Medfield abandoned the passing game this season, not throwing a single pass across two games and instead dedicating themselves fully to the run after having success late last season. \"Last year we struggled in the beginning, we tried to be an option team. It wasn't clicking,\" said coach Ormberg. \"We decided this offseason we're gonna start the way we finished.\" This new strategy has been successful, with Medfield not punting a single time this season. Despite their success, Ormberg noted the path ahead isn't an easy one. \"The road ahead is tougher. Hopkinton is Division 2 and we have them next week. Eight years ago was the last time Medfield scored 50 points, the next week we had Hopkinton and we lost,\" said Ormberg. \"We made the kids very aware of that, but we're excited, healthy, and never going to complain about starting the season 2-0.\"","url":null,"author":null},"lastUpdated":1757727964},{"id":44596,"date":"2025-09-12","homeConference":"Tri-Valley","visitorConference":"CMAC","tourneyName":null,"tourneyLevel":null,"time":"6:00 P.M.","label":"","status":"FINAL","teams":{"visitor":{"id":4486,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=football&school=blackstone-millville","name":"Blackstone-Millville\/Hopedale","score":"28","tracked":"1","outcome":"0"},"home":{"id":4251,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=football&school=millis","name":"Millis","score":"32","tracked":"1","outcome":"1"}},"overtime":null,"isShootoutWin":0,"gameUrl":null,"story":{"preview":null,"url":null,"author":null},"lastUpdated":1757728177}],"meets":[]},{"id":15,"name":"boys\u2019 golf","gender":"1","season":"fall","urls":[{"name":"Standings","url":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/standings?sport=boys-golf"},{"name":"Roundup","url":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/roundup?sport=boys-golf"}],"games":[{"id":52742,"date":"2025-09-12","homeConference":"Big Three","visitorConference":"South Coast","tourneyName":null,"tourneyLevel":null,"time":"3:15 P.M.","label":"","status":"UPCOMING","teams":{"visitor":{"id":4133,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=boys-golf&school=fairhaven","name":"Fairhaven","score":"","tracked":"1","outcome":null},"home":{"id":4273,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=boys-golf&school=new-bedford","name":"New Bedford","score":"","tracked":"1","outcome":null}},"overtime":null,"isShootoutWin":0,"gameUrl":null,"story":{"preview":null,"url":null,"author":null},"lastUpdated":1755628620},{"id":56615,"date":"2025-09-12","homeConference":"Catholic Central","visitorConference":"Catholic Central","tourneyName":null,"tourneyLevel":null,"time":"3:00 P.M.","label":"at Heather Hill Country Club, Plainville","status":"FINAL","teams":{"visitor":{"id":4012,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=boys-golf&school=archbishop-williams","name":"Archbishop Williams","score":"173","tracked":"1","outcome":"0"},"home":{"id":4042,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=boys-golf&school=bishop-feehan","name":"Bishop Feehan","score":"219","tracked":"1","outcome":"1"}},"overtime":null,"isShootoutWin":0,"gameUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/story\/?sport=boys-golf&id=20250912-1-archbishop-williams-bishop-feehan","story":{"preview":"Junior Gavin Walsh shot a 3-under-par 33 (42 points) to lead the Shamrocks (4-1) to a Catholic Central League win at Heather Hill Country Club.

Sage Young added 21 digs and five assists. \"It was a great game,\" said coach Mary Katherine Blakney. \"We're very well-matched teams. We were able to pull off the win in set one, where Monday we were on the short end of the 26-24 [against Oliver Ames]. It changed the dynamic of the game.\" For a team that graduated a strong core of hitters facing a team returning its core, Attleboro needed everyone to step up. Leonardo played the right side last year and Jaeger played some rotations at setter, but both are leading the charge at outside. \"When you have huge talent in a senior class, sometimes those behind them don't get the recognition they deserve,\" Blakney said. \"For Sophia last year and Liv both years, they haven't been able to shine.

It was a big night for him,\" said Malden coach Witchie Exilhomme. With Somerville (2-1) storming back with a 51-yard touchdown run from Ryan Louis, the Golden Tornado defense made a key stop on the ensuing 2-point conversion. Sophomore Josh Blye anchored the Malden defense, batting down five passes and making 10 tackles. Right alongside him was senior Waslin Etienne, who made four tackles for loss. Bouncing back from a tough loss last week, Exilhomme praised his defense for limiting a high-scoring Somerville offense. \"To come out there and be such a great team and play so solid on defense, it's like waking up from a bad dream,\" he said. After the bounce-back win, Exilhomme believes his team is ready for any challenge. \"To come back and beat one of the best teams in the conference, the sky's the limit for this team,\" he said. \"We're not afraid of anyone in this conference and we're ready to go after anyone.\"","url":null,"author":null},"lastUpdated":1758323558},{"id":44453,"date":"2025-09-18","homeConference":"Intercounty","visitorConference":"South Shore","tourneyName":null,"tourneyLevel":null,"time":"6:00 P.M.","label":"","status":"FINAL","teams":{"visitor":{"id":4327,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=football&school=randolph","name":"Randolph","score":"55","tracked":"1","outcome":"1"},"home":{"id":4361,"teamPageUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/schedule?sport=football&school=commerce","name":"Commerce","score":"14","tracked":"1","outcome":"0"}},"overtime":null,"isShootoutWin":0,"gameUrl":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/sports\/high-schools\/story\/?sport=football&id=20250918-1-randolph-commerce","story":{"preview":"Abe Cornet connected with Mekhi White for two passing touchdowns in a dominant nonleague road win, keeping the Blue Devils (3-0) undefeated. \"We have an incredibly talented group that's working to win,\" said Randolph coach Jonathan Marshall.

for most of the game, sophomore Zachary Fultz spearheaded an offensive surge, scoring three straight rushing touchdowns (60, 6, 63 yards) leading the Falcons (3-0) to a comeback nonleague home win. Along with his three rushing touchdowns, he also blocked a punt which was returned for another touchdown in the third quarter. \"He was out last week too,\" said Danvers coach Ryan Nolan. \"He really did a whole lot for the game, and he showed a lot of resilience.\" With resurgent Danvers taking a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, the Rockets (1-1) brought the game back within 2 points on an 11-yard touchdown catch from Bobby Morris. Danvers held on for the win, getting the ball back after the ensuing onside kick failed to travel 10 yards. \"It was an exciting game, a little nerve-wracking, but we'll take it,\" Nolan said. With such a young team, Nolan hoped his squad improved upon the fundamentals going forward. \"We've relied on a lot of grit, heart and toughness to come out on top these previous three games,\" he said. \"We just have to refine the things we're doing, our understanding, our depth and just get better every
